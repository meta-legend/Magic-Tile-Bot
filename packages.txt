Run these commands in a Administrator cmd window:
pip install pywin32
pip install keyboard
pip install pyautogui
pip install opencv-python

These commands will install the proper dependencies on your system.

Sorry, this bot at least I only made for windows but you could edit it to work for your respective operating system as long as it supports python.
